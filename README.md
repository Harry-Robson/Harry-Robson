## I'm a freelance software developer building on and around web3. I mainly use Python but I'm also learning Rust. 

### Some of the services I provide in the crypto sector:
* Creation and airdropping of SPL tokens
* NFT metadata bulk editing
* Solana NFT mint site config and deployment using Metaplex Candy Machine
* Backend development with Solana NFT interactions such as off-chain staking or proof of concept work with quick turn around compared to smart contract development

**If you'd like to contract me to work on your project please drop me a message on Twitter.**
