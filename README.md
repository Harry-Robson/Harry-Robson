## I'm a freelance software developer building on and around web3. I mainly use Python but I'm also working with some Rust. 

Feel free to message me on Twitter @HarryJRobson if you have an NFT project you'd like me to work on. If you have a large following or/and a unique idea that I like I'm open to working for equity.
