## Hello, I'm a freelance software developer working on workflow automation and backend web3 interactions. I mainly work use Python but I'm also learning Rust. If you'd like to collaborate on any projects give me a message!

### Some of the services I provide in the crypto sector:
* Creation and airdropping of SPL tokens
* NFT metadata bulk editing
* Solana NFT mint site config and deployment using Metaplex Candy Machine
* Backend development with Solana NFT interactions such as off-chain staking or proof of concept work with quick turn around compared to smart contract development

**If you'd like to contract me to work on your project please drop me a message on Twitter.**
